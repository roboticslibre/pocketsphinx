A Low-Cost Robot that is capable of learning voice commands  (Using Arduino, pocketsphinx, firmata and racket)
=======================

##Instruccions to run the applications



Open two terminals in which you are going to run each of the following commands:

$./main -lm lm.lm -dict dic.dic > capturedwords
$ racket voicecontrolcommands.rkt


##Voice Commmands

move forward
move in reverse  
["move backward" has been changed to "move in reverse" command since there is poor recogntion! "0 out of 10"]
spin left   [spin to turn; nonetheless, has not been well recognised]
spin right  [spin to turn; it works well]
move your eyes
move your head

go forward
go backward
rotate left
rotate right
stop right there
